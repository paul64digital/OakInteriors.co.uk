<a name="about"></a><br/><br/>

<p><b>About us:</b></p>

<p>Founded in 1918 by Harriet Smith, the first shop sold nursery goods 
and furniture. Harriet passed the business down to her sons Cecil and 
Albert, who concentrated on furniture, both new and used. Cecil's son 
Dennis joined in 1957 - and is still working a 6 day week, 44 years on!
 He expanded the business to a second store, and widened the product 
range to include carpets, and upholstery. By the early 90's, however, 
it became necessary to specialize to survive in the ever more 
competitive furniture trade. Thus the birth of Oak Interiors. Today, 
we are growing rapidly (some more rapidly than others):</p>

<br/>

<a name="service"></a><br/>

<p><b>Service:</b></p>

<p>We know you want great products, at great prices, 
with the best service. So that's what we try to do. 
Our products are carefully selected from across Europe to 
offer <b>great design</b>, and <b>high quality</b> at 
<b>affordable prices</b>.</p>

<p>We would rather not sell something than sell something the customer 
is not happy with - which is why we offer <b>an unconditional thirty 
day money back guarantee on all standard items in standard finishes.</b> 
This is designed to give our customers absolute confidence, and to 
eliminate the risk involved in making such a large purchase. Quite simply, 
if you're not absolutely satisfied with your purchase, for whatever reason, 
we will collect the item(s) in showroom condition and refund you in full, 
or exchange for another piece(s). Which means you bear no risk.</p>

<p>We offer a <b>free weekday delivery service</b> in Kent, Surrey, Essex, 
and inside the M25. We will assemble furniture where necessary, and 
dispose of all packaging, at no charge. Ordinarily we can give a 
two hour window during which we will deliver - so you don't have to 
wait in all day.</p><br/>
