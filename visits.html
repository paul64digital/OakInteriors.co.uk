<u>Factory Visits</u></font></p><br>

<p><font size="4">
The following are details about our visits we make every year to 
the furniture factories:</font></p>

<p>This is your unique opportunity to join a small group to visit one 
of the world's largest oak furniture manufacturers, in a relaxed and 
informal atmosphere, and to gain a facinating and valuable insight 
into furniture making. By seeing, first hand, exactly how furniture 
is made, you can be sure you made the <i><b>right choice, first 
time.</b></i></p>

<p>The KM factory is set on an impressive 86 acre site, and includes 
a stunning 17,000sq ft showroom offering inspiration for your home.</p>

<p><b><i>Book early!</i></b><br>
Places are strictly limited, and the trip is extremely popular, so
